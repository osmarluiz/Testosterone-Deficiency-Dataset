# Testosterone-Deficiency-Dataset

This Database contains 3397 patients for the consideration of Testosterone Deficiency.
The Research Ethics Committee of the State University of Feira de Santana, Bahia, Brazil, approved the study with the ethical approval code: 3,057,301.

All six features were obtained by low-cost exams/informations, which enable other researchers to add new data and try different algorithms.

Features:
- Age: in years (we only considered patients aged from 45-85 years);
- Triglycerides (TG): Integer Numbers (mg/dl);
- Waist Circumference (WC): in centimeters (medical literature usually thresholds at 102cm);
- HDL: Integer numbers (mg/dl);
- Hypertension: Binary, in which 1 is presence, and 0 is absence;
- Diabetes: Binary, in which 1 is presence, and 0 is absence.

Target:
- T: Testosterone (Medical Literature suggests a deficiency when T<300 ng/dl).
